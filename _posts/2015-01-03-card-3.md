I worked on a system that provides feedback on coding style for students in computer science classes. I was the primary author on a work-in-progress paper about it titled ["AutoStyle"](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2728672) which appeared at the conference [Learning at Scale 2015](http://learningatscale.acm.org/) in Vancouver, Canada.
