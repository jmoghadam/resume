I invented a toy implementation of the version control software __git__ that I named __gitlet__. This was used as the basis for a project students worked on in CS 61B. Gitlet can add, commit, checkout, branch, merge, and rebase (among other things). It also has basic remote features to push, fetch, and pull.
